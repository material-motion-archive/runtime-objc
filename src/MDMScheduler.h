/**
 An instance of MDMScheduler acts as the mediating agent between plans and performers.

 Plans are objects that conform to the MDMPlan protocol.
 Performers are objects that conform to the MDMPerforming protocol.

 ## Usage

 Many MDMScheduler instances may be instantiated throughout the lifetime of an app.
 Generally-speaking, one scheduler is created per interaction. An interaction might be a transition,
 a one-off animation, or a complex multi-state interaction.

 Plans can be associated with targets by using addPlan:to:.

 The scheduler creates performer instances when plans are added to a scheduler. Performers are
 expected to fulfill the provided plans.

 ## Lifecycle

 When an instance of MDMScheduler is deallocated its performers will also be deallocated.
